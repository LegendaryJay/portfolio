        The primary objectives of this project were to create an intuitive, well-designed, and mobile-friendly website. I aimed to showcase my attention to detail and present a visually appealing website that is both eye-catching and visually simple.

      <dt><strong>Responsive About Me Section</strong></dt>
      <dd>
        The About Me section went through several iterations to address readability issues at different page widths. Initially, I attempted to fix it by adjusting the font size based on view height, but this approach reduced accessibility. Eventually, I realized that making the website responsive should prioritize mobile devices first and then adjust for desktop. This change in approach allowed me to visualize the necessary modifications, resulting in the current design.

      <dt><strong>Scrolling and Small Page</strong></dt>
      <dd>
        Managing scrolling proved to be challenging. I wanted a button that could scroll automatically and the website to detect which page I was on. Initially, I faced difficulties with a feedback loop that would only scroll to the next page after detecting a click. Additionally, the contact me section was small, causing scrolling confusion and skipping detection. To resolve these issues, I removed the contact me section (integrating it into the home page) and improved the scrolling detection to determine the page when scrolling stopped.

        To initiate the design process, I meticulously documented all significant questions from the original page, excluding trivial queries like the current date, and rearranged them, consolidating duplicates and grouping questions based on their purpose.

      <dt><strong>Unmet Goals</strong></dt>
      <dd>
        Regrettably, several goals were left incomplete due to time constraints. Originally planned objectives, such as the implementation of disabled tabs until the previous page was completed, validation before progression, and conditional display of relevant elements (e.g., 21+ questions for the driver position) remain outstanding. Given my current experience, I could easily accomplish these objectives.
      </dd>

    <dl>
      <dt><strong>Unplanned Goals</strong></dt>
      <dd>
        In retrospect, it is evident that the website lacks mobile compatibility. If given the opportunity to redo the project, prioritizing mobile responsiveness would be one of my primary objectives. Considering that most users access websites through their mobile devices, the failure to plan for this aspect was an oversight I would not repeat.

        I felt that hardcoding database-related code everywhere in the program was not a good approach. Any changes to one part would require many modifications. To address this, I adopted a pattern similar to the repository pattern. I allowed interactions only with the <a href="https://github.com/LegendaryJay/JavascriptFinal/blob/master/src/model/UserRepository.js">UserRepository</a>, which handled all the specialized database operations while providing a general interface to the rest of the application.

        A significant amount of time was spent learning how Firebase authentication worked since it was new technology for me at the time.
