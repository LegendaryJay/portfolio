    When interviewing a software developer, or when working with a programming
    student, I look for several qualities to indicate their aptitude for success
    in this field:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Determination</strong>: Is this person going to pursue a problem
      to its solution, or will they give up and hand it over to someone else? I
      want someone who personally embraces each challenge and owns it.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Curiosity</strong>: It's not enough that something works â€“ they
      want to know why it works. What makes one solution better than another?
      Technology is always changing, so they keep one eye on the bigger picture.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Lateral thinking</strong>: Sometimes the best way to solve a
      problem is to turn it into an entirely different problem. Does this person
      exhibit radical creativity that can take us in new and better directions?
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Passion</strong>: Are they working on personal projects to keep
      their skills sharp and up to date? Software development is a field of
      perpetual learning, and that should excite them!
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    After having Dan Chianese as a student in several of my programming classes
    (ranging from beginner- to advanced-level), I can confidently say that I
    believe Dan will succeed as a software developer based on how strongly he
    exhibits these qualities. Because of his demonstrated creativity,
    determination, and hard work, I unreservedly recommend Dan as a valuable
    contributor to any development team.
  </p>
  <p>Sincerely,</p>
